# My Life

I figure Google (Email and Calendar), Apple (iPhone, iPad, laptop, etc.) Twitter, and so on already know me inside out, why not just do my life planning publicly? Plus maybe I get lucky and someone files a useful bug againsdt it.

This is a combination of systems (GTD, Wardley Mapping, etc.), habits and other lifestyle choices.

I'm lucky and privileged, in that I have the time to think about how I want to live my life, and the resources to pursue this. To quote the motivational posters:
